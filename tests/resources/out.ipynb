    "This snippet of code uses nbmake's NotebookRun class to test `res/x.ipynb` from a Python application. It starts by setting the `path` to the notebook, and the `timeout` for the notebook execution. Then a `NotebookRun` instance is created using the `filename` and `default_timeout` arguments. The notebook is then executed, and the result is checked for errors. If an error is found, it is printed out, otherwise a success message is printed."
